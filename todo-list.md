####To do list lab

For this exercise we'll build a simple to do app. A todo app is the canonical app, so much so that it is used to benchmark different front-end frameworks.  For this however, it's just you and the browser...NOTHING else. No libraries, no databases. 

Below is a wireframe that outlines what the app should look like. You can also probably glean details of it's functionality from the mockup. You will most certainly work with mockups/wireframes in your career as a developer, so this is good practice to get now.

* User should be able to enter text into the input text box,click add, which will add a new item to the list.
* "Items Remaining" should keep track of how many list items the user has completed. This count changes every time the user checks off an item in the "Completed" column. 
* A User should be able to remove a specified item from the list by clicking the remove button. 
* User should be able to leave the page, come back, and be presented with their app as they left it.
